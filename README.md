# Akshay S S — ECE Portfolio

How to run locally:
- Open `index.html` in a browser.

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1) Create a new repo and push these files.
2) In repo settings → Pages, set source to `main` branch `/ (root)`.
3) After it builds, the site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Add your files:
- Put your resume at `assets/Akshay-Resume.pdf`.
- Copy certificate PDFs/images into `assets/certificates/` and keep the names the same as in `script.js` or update paths there.
- Update experience/education in `script.js`.

Editing content:
- All data (skills, projects, certificates, links) lives in `script.js` inside constants: `PROFILE`, `SKILLS`, `PROJECTS`, `CERTS`, `EXPERIENCE`, `EDUCATION`.
- Change values and refresh the page.
